* Test Plan
** User Login
*** FR1
Setting up a repeatable test that covers everything for this feature would be
difficult to say the least, because it would require burning email accounts.
That is, once an email address is used to sign up, it cannot be re-used to test
this functional requirement. As a result, a new email would need to be created
each time we would want to run the test.  A compromise would be to delete the
email in our database, so that the user is still new to us, even though the
OAuth provider (In this case, Auth0) would still remember that the user had
previously authorized our application. An automated test for this feature would
be infeasible. A manual test should be designed instead.

** User Registration
*** FR2
Setting up a test for login will also be slightly difficult. For security reasons,
both GitHub and Google (the social login providers we chose) occasionally require
a code to be entered which is sent by e-mail.  For this reason, an automated test
would be infeasible. A manual test should be designed instead.

** Play Game
*** FR3 Create Game
To test this functionality, at least three users are required to test the requirement
that the game can start when three or more players are present as outlined in the
Software Requirements Specification. This needs to happen in three separate browser windows
either on the same computer, or on different computers. This makes an automated test
difficult, so a manual test should be designed instead.
