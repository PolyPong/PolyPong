ECE 493 Capstone History of Changes for PolyPong

Note:
The 'mantifao'  username refers to Micheal Antifaoff
The 'Arunscape' username refers to Arun Woosaree
The 'phlana'    username refers to Joshua Chang

This document is in reverse chronological order,
You may want to read the document from the bottom up.

the log was originally created with the following command:

```
git --no-pager log --graph --all --oneline --pretty=format:"%h %ad%x09%an%x09%s" --date=short
```

I chose to write comments in the middle of the commit history, so that there is
a better sense of the passage of time. Any line that does not start with a '*'
or a '|' is a comment I have written.

The convention I chose is that each comment will be referring to the
group of commits below it.

Note: there may be more commits above this one, but those relate to
the final submissions, and at this point the actual code for the project
is finalized.

================================================================================

Below here is the obvious last day frantic rush to get everything done.
Luckily, the code portion is basically done, and we just needed to
add comments, attaching our functional requrements.

Oh, and also finish all the reports. Turns out those were bigger than
I had anticipated. Micheal and I worked together to finish the test plan
and add comments to the code. 

We also ran all of our tests one last time to make sure that everything works
as expected. We somehow finished all of the functional requirements!

Joshua did not help at all with any of the final documents.

His contributions overall were limited for the entire project. 
With over 350 commits total, he had made under 10 of them.

It was time to start the final capstone assignments.
Turns out there is a lot of work to do.
Also, it turns out there was still a lot of functionality left to test.
I was definitely up past 1:30 am here.
I also started the test plan report.

|/  

In the days leading up to the demo, we had to get a lot done in a short period of time
You can see how many commits we did in such a short period of time. 
There were a bunch of bug fixes. In general, we were fixing a lot of
"jank" in the hopes that the demo would go smoothly. We think we did alright.
Joshua also helped to contribute a little. There was a regression where the
game state was being overwritten. In other words, there was a race condition
in the synchronization algorithm, and the game play was very jittery.
Luckily, we got that fixed thanks to the combined effort of three team members
this time.

page to communicate with the server functions I had set up earlier.

|/  

The work done is this block of commits is mostly Micheal, however,
I was with him in a Discord call for most of the time.
I believe I had other assignments due during this time period, however
I made an effort to be there so I could help debug things and fix
issues in a few minutes versus the hours that it could have taken
a single tired individual to find the bug. Two minds are better than one.

* 17d7cf7 2021-04-10	mantifao	This should fix one player game starting

* 543859b 2021-04-09	mantifao	Fixed a bug with lobby system: when two players are in a lobby and one lost connection, the other is now informed the lobby no longer exists; Fixed another bug where when a user exits the lobby, it is shown on all clients. Unless we find more bugs, lobby should be complete!
* bdf06cc 2021-04-09	mantifao	Lobby improvements, on closing a window, users are now removed from a lobby

This group of commits was another rare moment where we got all three team
members together in a call. There were some weird bugs, 
but we sat down for hours and got them fixed.
Joshua also implemented the Dead Reckoning Algorithm.

More pair programming between Micheal and I.
We encountered many issues with the lobby over the course of this project.

|/  

Another few days, more pair programming was going on.
At this point, I was missing lectures from other classes
and just focusing entirely on the capstone project because
all of the midterms were done. The signup process 
was not working as we expected, so I had to fix that, 
and I helpd Micheal implement a few power ups.
Credit should go mostly to Micheal for the power ups,
but I did help fix errors he encountered, and
helped with designing how the client server
communication works when a power up is activated.
Things like sending the update to the server,
merging the game state on the server, broadcasting
updates to the clients, and merging the game state on the clients.
We implemented a good amount of powerups and felt good about how the
project was looking so far.

More pair programming happened here.
I cleaned up some code, and changed how the frontend can
request data from the server for stateless things. I showed Micheal
how to consume the new endpoints, and together, we fixed some bugs
that existed in the code for the lobby system.

* c11e716 2021-04-02	Arunscape	set skin rest endpoint
* 72a2fb8 2021-04-02	Arunscape	remove unused code in server.ts


Finally, we had gotten all three team members together in a call.
I showed Joshua how to run the project and walked him through the
code we had already written so far. Even at this point, there was a lot to
go through. On April 1st, Joshua made his first commit to the repository.

Here, Micheal and I did a lot more pair programming. We added a buch of
features together, and fixed some bugs. At this point, we had a working game
basically, and we could spend some time having fun bouncing a ball
off of some paddles. Another exciting development was that I managed
to deploy our code to a server, so that a production version
of the website is accessible at https://polypong.ca
We could finally share our project with friends!
(Even though we were far from done at this point)
I also wrote tests for the database functions.

In this group of commits, Micheal and I over several days pair programmed
even more together, and we got a lot of work done. At this point, 
I will admit that I was a bit worried that Joshua had many opportunities
to join the video calls Micheal and I had on Discord, and he had not
contributed any code yet or talked about the project much
-- especially because Micheal and I were sending messages back and forth which 
are supposed to send notifications in Discord.

I had also created some database functions in this group of commits.
At this time, I had asked Joshua about a week ago
to research a bit about MongoDB and Deno,
and see if he could start writing some interfaces, and maybe
a few database functions to see how we can interact with the database.
We didn't really hear from him for a while aside from the Monday meeting
we had established, and in order to progress with the project, we needed
to start doing some database stuff.

In this group of commits, Micheal and I did a bunch of pair programming together.
We fixed issues with the login system, I showed him how the lobby system I made
in the previous group of commits work, how the store works, and he showed me
the changes he made to the frontend. I showed Micheal how to use
WebSockets and how he could build on top of my existing code 
in the backend. We spend a lot of time on a discord call together.


* a3da283 2021-03-22	mantifao	Log In on Home page now prints user email to console if authenticated
* 07f5092 2021-03-22	mantifao	Fix Auth0 bugs

* 4d4227e 2021-03-19	mantifao	Change default port to 3000

Variables in a tree structure are kind of tricky. If you want
something to be accessible by two components, you need to go to the parent
of each nodes until you find a common ancestor, and then pass the state down
to the children. Luckily, Svelte provides a store which simplifies this process.
We effectively abused a bunch of global variables.

* ec001d6 2021-03-19	Arunscape	attempt to start game
* a395ced 2021-03-19	Arunscape	moved client side lobby websocket stuff to global scope in store.ts

These changes are not really groundbreaking. It's mostly clean up.

We had a rather large amount of diagrams to make around this time,
and I chose to do the sequence diagrams for our system.

With Micheal having added some basic frontend stuff already, we did not have
much of a backend yet. I was the most knowledgeable in the area, and 
this seemed like the next big thing to do, so I started making a
lobby system. I had never worked with WebSockets before, so there was a good
amount of trial and error here.

* c6c7837 2021-03-10	Arunscape	the websocket is now accessible from anywhere in the application
* 04c6bb7 2021-03-09	Arunscape	use the types I defined for transmitting messages
* de4b815 2021-03-09	Arunscape	add joinsuccesspayload to payload.ts
* c9a8575 2021-03-09	Arunscape	fixed the enter lobby id bug. now uses the textbox input
* e250620 2021-03-08	Arunscape	here's what the communication protocol might look like
* f9e9273 2021-03-08	Arunscape	hey we can now create a lobby, and join it with a unique id!!!
* b180a2f 2021-03-08	Arunscape	add uuid

We mentioned that we chose TypeScript, so that the frontend
and backend can depend on the same data interfaces and make our lives easier.
We were not doing that yet, so I began the process of separating out
types and interfaces that would be shared between both the frontend and backend.

* 0d70162 2021-03-05	Arunscape	package-lock go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
* 95a3d19 2021-03-05	Arunscape	document how to install private package

* c6d248a 2021-03-05	Arunscape	v0.0.1
* 0a64f51 2021-03-05	Arunscape	move Game types to npm package

Micheal did some good work here. He managed to figure out how to
draw to the canvas, and did some geometry math/magic. We could see
things coming together here. It was far from a functional game,
but we could move one paddle, and see a ball moving.

* 51b2d4e 2021-03-01	mantifao	Player number done; paddles rotate accordingly
* 0d60aee 2021-03-01	mantifao	Ball now scales based on client's window size

I committed the work breakdown structure instead of using google drive,
because I prefer working with plain text files, and then compiling
my drawings from those files. Using a mouse with graphics software is a
nightmare. And, plain text works beautifully with git.

* 6f9fadb 2021-02-25	Arunscape	work breakdown structure

In this group of commits, I was working on porting Micheal's vanilla HTML and
CSS mockup to using the Svelte framework so that we could start leveraging
its features.

* 345723b 2021-02-17	Arunscape	idk what I changed but it works beautifully now. If the user is already signed in, they are no longer prompted for credentials

* 5c62216 2021-02-15	Arunscape	add auth0 client library
* ccea9cc 2021-02-08	Arunscape	frontend mockup but now in Svelte still kind of ugly because we're not reusing components, but hey, it's a start
* 739fbe9 2021-02-08	Arunscape	actually let's try svelte@next
* f51de3c 2021-02-08	Arunscape	add lockfile to gitignore for now
* 3573a86 2021-02-08	Arunscape	use typescript
* 0acc958 2021-02-08	Arunscape	init svelte

These last two commits were just me copying over the mockups that
Micheal had made to the master branch

* 4369d8e 2021-02-08	Arunscape	move frontend mockup
* bd0191d 2021-02-08	Arunscape	copy over stuff from main branch

I had started work just a day later, however, I used a different branch 
than Micheal's. It turns out GitHub changed their default branch name
from 'master' to 'main' and I was still using the old convention.
From past projects, like for hackathons and such authentication
has always been a huge time sink, so I decided to start with that.
At this point, I had a basic sign in demo that I could
show to Micheal and Josh.

* 7b293ed 2021-02-06	Arunscape	signin works
* d38e4b4 2021-02-06	Arunscape	signin works

Micheal kicked off the project with the first few commits.
Being new to web development, he took the time and effort
to familiarize himself with basic HTML and CSS knowledge,
knowing that there was a mountain of work ahead to do.
